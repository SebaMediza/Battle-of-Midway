      # 1943: The Battle of Midway is a 1987 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and published by Capcom.[1]
      # It was the first follow-up to Capcom's earlier 1942. Like 1942, despite the game being created by Japanese developers.
      # Tt has the player-controlled Americans attacking the Japanese air fleet. 
      # This was due to being one of the first Capcom games designed with Western markets in mind. 
      # The game's name is a reference to the Battle of  Midway, which occurred in June 1942.
